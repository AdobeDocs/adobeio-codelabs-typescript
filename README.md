# Using TypeScript to develop in Project Firefly

This codelab will guide you through creating a headless app using [Project Firefly](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly) the twist is that instead of using Javascript we will be using TypeScript.   


- Do you like a little more structure in your Firefly project? 
- Does the thought of loosely typed code make you loose sleep?
- Do you enjoy better refactoring tooling?
- Does having interfaces, namespaces, generics, abstract classes, data modifiers, optionals, function overloading, decorators, type utils, and the readonly keyword sound like it would make your project better?    


If you answered yes to any of the questions above then I think you should investigate using TypeScript with Project Firefly.
